# Autonomous Robotic Arm with 3 Degrees of Freedom Using Machine Learning and Object Detection

**Overview**

This project involves designing and building an autonomous robotic arm with three degrees of freedom (3DOF) that uses machine learning (ML) and object detection for intelligent decision-making. The robotic arm can autonomously identify, track, and interact with objects in its workspace. The inspiration for this project comes from Dum-E, the robotic assistant in the Iron Man movie. Our group wants to build an arm that could compete with industrial automation in price and efficiency.
