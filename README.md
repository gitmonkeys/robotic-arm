# Autonomous Robotic Arm with 3 Degrees of Freedom Using Machine Learning and Object Detection

**Overview**

This project involves designing and building an autonomous robotic arm with three degrees of freedom (3DOF) that uses machine learning (ML) and object detection for intelligent decision-making. The robotic arm is capable of identifying, tracking, and interacting with objects in its workspace autonomously.
